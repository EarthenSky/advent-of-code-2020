 Solutions to advent of code 2020 puzzles

### Directories:
- src_decaf/ -> programs written using the decaf programming language as described here ( http://anoopsarkar.github.io/compilers-class/decafspec.html )

#### Decaf Side Note:
I'm currently not able to make my decaf compiler public, however it should be relatively trivial to convert those programs into C, java, etc.

If you're honestly interested in this version of decaf (why?) see here ( https://github.com/anoopsarkar/compilers-class-hw )
