 Solutions to advent of code 2020 puzzles

### Sub goals:
In addition to trying to solve all of the puzzles within 2020, my sub goals are (in order of importance):
- 1. to make every solution run consistently in less than a second on my computer (8 3.6ghz cores, nvidea 960 gpu).
- 2. to make every solution as simple as possible
- 3. to make every solution as small as possible

### Directories:
- src_decaf/ -> programs written using the decaf programming language as described here ( http://anoopsarkar.github.io/compilers-class/decafspec.html )
- src_python/ -> using python version 3.7
- src_cs/ -> c# using mono 6.12 through windows 10

#### Decaf Side Note:
I'm currently not able to make my decaf compiler public, however it should be relatively trivial to convert those programs into C, java, etc.

If you're honestly interested in this version of decaf (why?) see here ( https://github.com/anoopsarkar/compilers-class-hw )
